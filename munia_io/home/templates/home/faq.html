							<li class="content-visible">
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Does use of this product incur input lag?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content content-visible">No. All MUNIA devices <em>tap</em> the
									controller signals but do not interrupt them. Theoretically the device could
									block the connection between console and controller entirely, but it will never
									modify or delay the contents of the packets being transmitted. This means the
									device is both safe for competitive play and its use is permitted in all speedrun
									communities.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you offer warranty on the devices?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Full 1-year carry-in warranty is provided for any hardware defects.
									If unforeseen incompatibilities are found I make every effort to add support for your setup,
									which after applying a firmware update might become supported. When in doubt whether
									your exotic setup will be supported, please contact me first.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How does this product compare to NintendoSpy?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Favorably. Benefits include not having to
									splice any cables, the device showing up as HID device on your computer, superior
									software, more stable firmware, ability to use the controller on your PC in e.g.
									emulators and better 3rd party controller support. In the end, though, both work
									and the MUNIA software also supports inputs from Arduino-based NintendoSpy devices!
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will you support console ‘X’?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Unless mentioned on the index page, the likely answer is no.
									The newer the console, the less likely it is we are able to tap into their signals.
									Especially USB or wireless controllers are unlikely to happen.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Does it work with third-party controllers?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Many third-party controllers are known for being out of spec
									but the MUNIA devices make every effort to properly handle these. For Nintendo 64,
									Hori controllers are fully supported.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I already have an arduino setup. Can I still use the software?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Yes! The NintendoSpy/Arduino solution outputs the ones and zeroes on the
									controller line over a serial port to the PC. The MUNIA software can parse these packets
									and use them to animate SNES, N64 and Gamecube skins. This is not as powerful as the USB HID device
									as which the MUNIA presents itself, but at least it works well enough with official controllers.
								</div>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<ul id="software" class="cd-faq-group blank">
							<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Software</h2></li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I customize the built-in skins?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Yes, in two ways. The software has a built-in color theming
									engine which allows you to specify the fill and stroke for all components that are
									part of an existing skin. This is a convenient and simple way of recoloring existing
									skins and quickly making multiple themes for them.
									<img src="{% static "img/content/remap_engine.png" %}" alt="Theming engine">
									<p></p>
									A more powerful way that gives you full control over the look of your skin
										is to use a vector graphics editing program such as Adobe Illustrator
										or Inkscape. Both will let you fully modify every aspect of the skin.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I show my inputs with OBS?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">The preferred way is to use a <em>Game Capture</em> source in
									OBS. This allows you to use proper transparency without setting a colorkey, and it's
									the most efficient method of capturing since MUNIA is rendered using OpenGL.
									Unfortunately there are reports of Game Capture mode not working in OBS in which
									case resorting to Window Capture is a workable solution, but you should first
									attempt to make Game Capture work!
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My capture card has some input delay. How do I synchronize the viewer?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">The software has a convenient input-lag compensation feature. It is able to store
									captured inputs and accurately delay them by any number of frames. This option is available from the
									<em>Options / Set lag compensation</em> menu.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there any alternatives to the accompanying software?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Since the MUNIA devices present themselves to the PC as USB HID
									gamepads, any software that takes inputs from such controllers will work. Known alternatives
									are <a href="https://gamepadviewer.com">gamepadviewer.com</a> and
									<a href="https://github.com/lifning/padpyght">padpyght</a>.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I add a new skin?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Skins are defined as SVG files with embedded attributes
									identifying varying parts of the controller. Any controller that identifies itself
									as a USB HID device can be supported with a custom skin. You can draw skins with
									vector graphics editing programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.
									A
									<a href="https://github.com/zzattack/munia/blob/master/SKINS.md">reference guide</a>
									for making skins compatible with your controller can be found on the Github project pages.
								</div>
							</li>

						</ul>

						<ul id="misc" class="cd-faq-group blank">
							<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Miscellaneous</h2></li>
							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does ‘MUNIA’ mean?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">The very first iteration of the device supported SNES, N64
									and NGC simultaneously. The acronym was for ‘Multi-use Nintendo Input Adapter’.
									Both the Multi-use and Nintendo parts no longer apply universally,
									so we’ve parted with the acronym but kept the pretty name.
